# PyBer Analysis

## Overview of Project

The purpose of this project is to create a summary of total weekly fare data by city type. And create a line chart to visualize the data. This data will be used to make decisions at PyBer.

## Results

From the summary data frame it's clear that Urban city type has the highest total fares, followed by Suburban type cities, and then Rural type cities. Urband cities comprise 62.7% of Total Fares, Suburbs are at 30.5%, and Rural cities make up 6.8%. Rural cities have the highest average fare per driver and per ride, followed by Suburbs, and Urban cities. The data confirms the natural assumption that Urban cities have the highest total ride count and that Rural cities have the lowest. Urban cities seem to have more flutuation in fares in the month of March, as there are some peaks and vallies. In comparison, Suburban and Rurual cities are relatively stable during March. However Urban cities remain the highest with total fares despite these slight dips. All three types appear to experience a moderate peak towards the end of February.

## Summary

One conclusion that might be drawn from this data is that Rural cities shoould be supported with more drivers to increase fares. However Rural cities have limited populations so an increase in drivers wouldn't necessarily result in increased fares. It likely only serve to reduce the average fare per driver. Suburban population trends could be examined to determine if more people are moving to the Suburbs. And if there is a trend of increasing Suburban populations, then hiring more drivers in Suburban cities could lead to an increase in fares. Currently it makes most sense to support Urban cities the most as they are over half of the Total Fares. Also it would be beneficial to look at lost fares during the peak at the end of February to determine of more temporary drivers should be hired to capture more sales. In this case all three city types could see an increase in Total Fares at this time if there are currently not enough drivers to support the demand at that time.
