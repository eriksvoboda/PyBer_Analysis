# PyBer Analysis

## Overview of Project

The purpose of this project is to create a summary of total weekly fare data by city type. And create a line chart to visualize the data. This data will be used to make decisions at PyBer.

## Results

From the summary data frame it's clear that Urban city type has the highest total fares, followed by Suburban type cities, and then Rural type cities. Urband cities comprise 62.7% of Total Fares, Suburbs are at 30.5%, and Rural cities make up 6.8%. Rural cities have the highest average fare per driver and per ride, followed by Suburbs, and Urban cities. The data confirms the natural assumption that Urban cities have the highest total ride count and that Rural cities have the lowest. Urban cities seem to have more flutuation in fares in the month of March, as there are some peaks and vallies. In comparison, Suburban and Rurual cities are relatively stable during March. However Urban cities remain the highest with total fares despite these slight dips. All three types appear to experience a moderate peak towards the end of February.
